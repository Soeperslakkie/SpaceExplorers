Phobos is one of Mars' two moons, the smaller and closer of the two. With a diameter of about 22 kilometers (14 miles), it's irregularly shaped and heavily cratered. Its rapid orbit brings it close to Mars' surface, causing it to rise and set twice each Martian day. Phobos is thought to be a captured asteroid or a remnant of a larger body.
