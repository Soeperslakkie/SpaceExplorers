The Moon, Earth’s only natural satellite, orbits at about 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles) away. Formed around 4.5 billion years ago, it affects Earth’s tides and features a surface marked by craters and plains. The Moon was famously visited during NASA’s Apollo missions and has inspired countless myths, art, and scientific curiosity throughout history.
