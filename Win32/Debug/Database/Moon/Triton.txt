Triton is Neptune's largest moon and the seventh-largest in the Solar System. With a diameter of about 2,700 kilometers (1,680 miles), it features a frozen, icy surface and geysers that spout nitrogen gas. Triton orbits Neptune in a retrograde motion, suggesting it may have been captured by Neptuneâ€™s gravity. Its unique characteristics make it a fascinating subject for scientific study.
