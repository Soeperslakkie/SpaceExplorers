Deimos is the smaller of Mars' two moons, with a diameter of about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles). It has a smooth, heavily cratered surface and orbits Mars at a greater distance and slower speed compared to Phobos. Deimos rises and sets only once every 30.3 hours. Its irregular shape and low density suggest it may be a captured asteroid.
