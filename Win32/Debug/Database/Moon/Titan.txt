Titan is Saturn's largest moon and the second-largest in the Solar System. With a diameter of about 5,150 kilometers (3,200 miles), it has a thick atmosphere rich in nitrogen and methane, and features lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane. Titan's dense atmosphere and surface liquids make it a key target for studies on prebiotic chemistry and potential habitability.
