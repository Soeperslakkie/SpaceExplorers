Io is one of Jupiter's largest moons, known for its intense volcanic activity. With a diameter of about 3,640 kilometers (2,260 miles), it's the most geologically active body in the Solar System, featuring hundreds of volcanoes and lava plains. Its volcanic eruptions are driven by tidal heating from Jupiter's gravitational pull.
