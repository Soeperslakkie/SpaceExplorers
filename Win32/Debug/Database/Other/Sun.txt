The Sun is the central star of our Solar System, a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma with a diameter of about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles). It accounts for more than 99.8% of the Solar System's total mass. The Sun's core generates energy through nuclear fusion, producing light and heat that sustain life on Earth. Its outer layers include the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona, which influence space weather and solar activity.
