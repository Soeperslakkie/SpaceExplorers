The Kuiper Belt is a region of the Solar System extending beyond the orbit of Neptune, roughly between 30 and 55 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. It is populated with small icy bodies and dwarf planets, including Pluto, Haumea, and Makemake. The Kuiper Belt is similar to the asteroid belt but much larger and more distant. It is thought to be a remnant from the early Solar System, and its objects are believed to be composed primarily of water, methane, and ammonia ices.
