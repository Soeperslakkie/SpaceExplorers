Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is renowned for its stunning ring system, which is the most extensive and bright in the solar system. With a diameter of about 116,460 kilometers (72,367 miles), itâ€™s the second-largest planet after Jupiter. Saturn is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. It has a relatively low density and a fast rotation, completing a spin in just about 10.7 hours. The planet has 83 confirmed moons, with Titan being the largest and one of the most interesting due to its thick atmosphere and liquid lakes.
