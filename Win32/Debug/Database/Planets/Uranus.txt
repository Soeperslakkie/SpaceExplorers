Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is an ice giant with a diameter of about 50,724 kilometers (31,518 miles). It has a unique tilt, rotating on its side with an extreme axial tilt of about 98 degrees, which causes extreme seasonal variations. Uranus has a pale blue color due to its atmosphere, which is mainly hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane. It has a faint ring system and 27 known moons. Its cold atmosphere and unusual tilt make it one of the more mysterious planets in our solar system.
