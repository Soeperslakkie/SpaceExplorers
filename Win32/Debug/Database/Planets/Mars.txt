Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is known for its reddish appearance due to iron oxide on its surface. It has a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers (4,212 miles) and features the tallest volcano, Olympus Mons, and the largest canyon, Valles Marineris, in the solar system. Mars has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with surface temperatures averaging around -60C (-80F). It has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, and has been a primary target for exploration due to its potential for past water and habitability.
