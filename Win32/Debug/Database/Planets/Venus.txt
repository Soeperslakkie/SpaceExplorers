Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is similar in size to Earth but has a thick, toxic atmosphere of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds. This creates extreme heat, making it the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures over 460C (860F). Venus has a slow, retrograde rotation, meaning its day is longer than its year, and its surface is hidden by dense clouds.
