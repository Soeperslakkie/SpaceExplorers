Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is a dynamic world with diverse ecosystems and complex climate systems. Covering about 71% water and 29% land, it supports a wide range of life, from microscopic organisms to large mammals. Its atmosphere, mainly nitrogen and oxygen, protects life from harmful solar radiation and helps regulate temperature. Geologically active, Earth features tectonic movement that shapes its landscapes and causes phenomena like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. As the only known planet to support life, Earth is unique in its ongoing evolution and adaptation.
