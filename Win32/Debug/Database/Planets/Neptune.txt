Neptune, the eighth planet from the Sun, is a distant ice giant with a diameter of about 49,244 kilometers (30,598 miles). Itâ€™s known for its striking blue color, which comes from methane in its atmosphere. Neptune has strong winds and storm systems, including the Great Dark Spot, similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. It has a faint ring system and 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and geologically active. Neptune's orbit takes about 165 Earth years to complete.
