Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, is the smallest in our solar system, with a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles). It has a thin atmosphere, leading to extreme temperature changes between day and night. Mercury orbits the Sun in just 88 Earth days and rotates slowly, taking 59 Earth days to complete one rotation. Its surface features numerous craters, similar to the Moon.
