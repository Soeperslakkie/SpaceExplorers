Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, is the largest in the solar system, with a diameter of about 139,820 kilometers (86,881 miles). Known for its prominent Great Red Spot—a massive storm—Jupiter has a thick atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. It has a strong magnetic field, a ring system, and 95 confirmed moons, including the four largest, known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Jupiter's immense size and powerful storms make it a key focus of planetary research.
