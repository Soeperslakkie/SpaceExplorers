Eris is a dwarf planet located in the scattered disk, a distant region of the Solar System. With a diameter of about 2,326 kilometers (1,445 miles), it is slightly smaller than Pluto but has more mass. Eris has a highly elliptical orbit and is known for its extremely cold surface and a moon named Dysnomia. Its discovery in 2005 helped redefine the criteria for classifying planets and contributed to Pluto's reclassification as a dwarf planet.
