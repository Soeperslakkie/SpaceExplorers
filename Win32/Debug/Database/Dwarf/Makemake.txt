Makemake is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune. With a diameter of about 1,430 kilometers (890 miles), it is one of the largest known trans-Neptunian objects. Makemake has a reddish surface and is known for its relatively high albedo, meaning it reflects a lot of sunlight. It was discovered in 2005 and is named after a deity from Easter Island mythology.
