Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is classified as a dwarf planet. With a diameter of about 940 kilometers (580 miles), it features a diverse surface with craters, bright spots (likely salt deposits), and a large, possibly icy, dome-shaped mountain. Ceres has been studied by NASA's Dawn mission, revealing its complex geology and potential for subsurface water.
