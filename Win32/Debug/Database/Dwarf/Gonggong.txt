Gonggong is a dwarf planet located in the scattered disk, a distant region of the Solar System. With a diameter of about 1,230 kilometers (765 miles), it is one of the largest known trans-Neptunian objects. Gonggong has a reddish color due to its surface composition and a highly eccentric orbit. It was discovered in 2007 and is named after a Chinese water god.
